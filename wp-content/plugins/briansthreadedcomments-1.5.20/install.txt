*** Brians Threaded Comments 1.5 ***
----------------------------------------
2005-03-15 / Brian Meidell / version 1.5

In the following, <top> represents the directory in which you have installed wordpress.
This is the directory that contains your wp-config.php.

To install brians threaded comments, do the following:
	1) Before beginning, make backup copies of <top>/wp-content/themes/<yourtheme>/comments.php
	2) Copy briansthreadedcomments.php to <top>/wp-content/plugins/
	3) Copy comments.php to <top>/wp-content/theme/<yourtheme>/
	4) Activate brians threaded comments from the plugin page

That should be it.
Please note that the comments.php file is made so it fits with the default Kubrick theme.

Thanks to Mark Jaquith (http://txfx.net/) for some good pointers.
Thanks to Martin Geisler (http://mgeisler.net) for bugfixes and closing a security hole.

Have fun and enjoy.
